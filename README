How to run the game, Rock Paper Scissors:

Start by plugging in 2 funkits into the USB ports of the UC lab computer
Run 'make program' in the /ence260-ucfk4/assignment/group223 directory
for each funkit

How to play:
You can toggle moves of either Rock, Paper or Scissors by navigating left
or right on the navswitch. 'P' stands for Paper, 'R' stands for Rock 
and 'S' stands for scissors. To select your move push the navswitch in.
The screen will then re-display your selection, ready to be confirmed.

Press the navswitch in to confirm your move. Ensure that both funkits
IR transmitters are facing each other. You should then see the result of the
game by either a 'You win' or a 'You lose' message. 

You will then be taken back to the start of the game for endless amounts of fun!

If IR transmittion has failed the screen will display 'Try again', where it
will take you back to the start of the game, to have another go.
